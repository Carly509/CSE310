# Overview

for now this is just a hello word project but Im trying to work on a software project that  is a console-based To-Do List Manager written in C++. It is designed to help users organize and manage daily tasks by allowing them to add, remove, and view tasks easily. The goal of this project is to deepen practical understanding of core C++ programming concepts including object-oriented design, standard library usage, and file input/output operations.

The purpose of creating this software is to gain hands-on experience with C++ features such as classes, vectors from the Standard Template Library (STL), conditionals, loops, and file handling. By building this project, I am advancing my skills as a software engineer in developing maintainable, modular, and user-friendly console applications.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using XCode as the integrated development environment (IDE).

The programming language used is C++, embracing modern standards to make use of features such as STL containers (`std::vector`), file streams, and object-oriented programming constructs.
